*.m files are Matlab code files, which we ran using Matlab R2021b.
*.py files are pytnon3.9 code files.


# List of provided files

## Implementation files:
- README - this file
- find_lb.m - the implementation of Alg. 1 from the paper. Type "help find_lb" for input and output arguments.



## Experiment files

-The following scripts use the data file USCensus1990raw.data.mat which can be downloaded from the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/US+Census+Data+(1990)
  - census_commands.m - the script for running the experiments for binary classification with beta = 1 on the UC Census data set. 
  - census_commands_beta.m - the script for running the experiments for binary classification with variable beta on the UC Census data set. 
- cancer.m - a script for running the experiments on the classifiers generated from search-engine data. 
- poll_run.m - a script for running the poll experiments. This script requires downloading the relevant data; 
See explanataions on how to do this in the comment at the top of the script. 
- cancer_mortality.m - a script for running the cancer mortality experiments. This script requires downloading the relevant data; 
See explanataions on how to do this in the comment at the top of the script.
- simpleClassifierAnalysis.m - an auxiliary file
- generate_compas_classifier.py - generate the classifier for the COMPAS dataset, save informaion into a csv file.
- compas.m - generate output for the COMPAS experiments
- adultRunExp.m - generate output for the Adult experiments

### Data files
- cancer_data.m - the statistics of the classifiers generated by the search-engine data in the first reported experiment. Used by the cancer.m script

### Auxiliary files used by the files above:

- calcunfairness.m
- calculate_classifier.m
- find_best_alphas.m



### Data files used to generate paper graphs:
The following files contain the experiment results that were used to generate the graphs in the paper.
